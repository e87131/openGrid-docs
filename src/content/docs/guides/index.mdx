* Use as little parts as possible to keeps things easy to explain and understand.
* Use less filament than other common comparable frameworks  
  (-70% for lite board, -30% for full board - compared to simlilar solutions)
* Be compatible to existing solutions out there (like Gridfinity)
* Be open and allow people to extend things
