Snap-in connectors for your board hold your things in place.
You can insert them into your board and connect things to them.

## Resources

In the files section of each website, you can find a folder containing the snaps.

* [openGrid on printables](https://www.printables.com/model/1214361-opengrid-walldesk-mounting-framework-and-ecosystem)
* [openGrid on makerworld](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1179191-opengrid-wall-desk-mounting-framework-ecosystem)
* [openGrid Metric Screw Snaps](https://www.printables.com/model/1217921-opengrid-metric-screw-snaps)

You can also create your own or expand the selection. More info and some helpful information can be found at the page for [parts modeling](./modeling).

## Types

### Mounting Snap
Include a screwhole for mounting your openGrid to a surface.
You can use these instead of mounting holes in the grid itself for more flexibility.

### Bare Snap
Bare (or "cover") snaps clean up the look of your board and can help with cable routing or be used as a flat bottom for [NeoGrid](../projects/neogrid).

### Directional Snap
Directional snaps are used for vertically mounted boards to provide extra strength in one direction (usually downward) so your snap-in tiles don't pull out even under heavy weight.
They feature a small arrow at the back to indicate the fixed direction. The other three sides use the basic, flexible snap-ins.

### Lock Snap
The lock snap consists of two parts: The snap itself and a printed screw that, when screwed into the snap, expands the tile slightly to hold it securely in place. This results in a locked, sturdy connection independent of orientation, unlike the directional snap.

### Multiconnect Snap
The lock snap consists of two parts: The snap itself and a printed screw that, when screwed into the snap, expands the tile slightly to hold it securely in place. This results in a locked, sturdy connection independent of orientation, unlike the directional snap.
You can hang any part with multiconnect rails onto this snap and remove them as easily for more flexibility by swapping out the connected accessory.
